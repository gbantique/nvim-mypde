Today I took my psychological examination in Davao. I supposedly be in Davao by 10 in the morning by I arrived in the clinic around quarter to 11. I was so late by thankfully, I still able to take the examination. 

By around 11:50AM, the examiner said times up and I am not able to finish answering the questionaire. I think I am only halfway the D set. Every set is composed of 12 questions.
